# Werewolves on the Clocktower
Personal and unoptimized project, mostly based on code provided by ChatGPT to help me be the irl Moderator/Storyteller of a irl Werewolf of the Miller's Hollow mod I created adding some functionalities from Blood on the Clock Tower.

Functionalities:
- Input the number of players.
- Get a selection of characters balanced to the number of players.
- If there's more than the maximum number of unique characters, normal sad villagers (and a normal werewolf every 4 players) will be added to the list.
- Generate a table with all the characters of the game in a random order and with cells for player names; poisoned, dead, done and host toggles, and a noteblock.
- Generate images with descriptions for every character in-game, in the order of the table (to send to the players --> left click to CTRL+C automatically).
- Generate the script dynamic to the characters in-game and their state (left-click a line to apply text-decoration: line-through)

For now, there are only Portuguese results, I'm planning to add Frech results next and finally, maybe, English, and if I'm really passionate, maybe I'll make it more appealing and usable by people other than me, even adding the Rules Manual for the Mod in the different languages.

Anyway, since it's not the most handcrafted program and is quite unoptimized, if you find any use for it, maybe for your normal Werewolf/Mafia games, download it, change it as you like, optimize it, publish it, idc, I hope you enjoy!

If for any reason you want to contact me you can also DM me @an_jo_morto on IG.

Oh, and all images were downloaded from https://www.loups-garous-en-ligne.com/, the text was added by me in a Word document I screenshoted, indeed very professional.
