# üåï Werewolves on the Clocktower üè∞

## Welcome to the Den of Deceit!

Unleash the mystical power of Werewolves on the Clocktower, a clandestine project born from the shadows to assist you in orchestrating the grand spectacle of Werewolf of the Miller's Hollow. This mod is imbued with secret functionalities whispered by the spirits of Blood on the Clock Tower.

### Dark Secrets Unveiled

1. **Invoke the Count:** Input the sacred number of players ready to engage in the mysterious dance of the wolves.

2. **Cryptic Character Selection:** Receive an enigmatic selection of characters, carefully balanced for the number of players.

3. **Fallback Villagers:** Should the number of arcane characters surpass the limits, ordinary villagers and a lone werewolf (every 4 players) emerge from the shadows to fill the void.

4. **Table of Shadows:** Conjure a table with all the characters, arranged in a chaotic dance. The table reveals cells for player names, poisoned, dead, done, and a mystic noteblock.

5. **Image Glyphs:** Evoke images adorned with descriptions for each character, perfectly aligned with the mystical table. Left-click to wield the power of copy.

6. **Dynamic Script of Fate:** Unveil a script that morphs with the characters' states. Left-click to invoke the ethereal `text-decoration: line-through` spell.

### Whispers of Languages

Currently, the incantations are uttered in Portuguese. Future plans include attuning the magic to French, and perhaps English. The ultimate quest may lead to making the grimoire more versatile, including Rules Manuals in diverse tongues.

### Conjuring Contributions

Feel free to summon, shape, and wield the project as you see fit. Whether for your nightly Werewolf rituals or to contribute to its arcane evolution, may the spirits guide you!
