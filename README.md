# WerewolfMax
Personal and unoptimized project, mostly based on code provided by ChatGPT to help me be the irl Moderator/Storyteller of a irl Werewolf of the Miller's Hollow mod I create adding some functionalities from Blood on the Clock Tower.
For now there's only portuguese results even if the whole UI is in English, I'm planning to add next Frech results and finally maybe English, and if I'm really passionate, maybe change the UI language and make it more appealing and usable by people other than me, even adding the Rules Manual for the Mod in the different languages.

Anyway, since it's not the most handcrafted program and is quite unoptimized, if you find any use for it, maybe for your normal Werewolf/Mafia games, download it, change it as you like, optimize it, publish it, idc, I hope you enjoy!

If for any reason you want to contact me you can also DM me @an_jo_morto on IG.
